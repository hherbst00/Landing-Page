# Landing-Page
Creating the Odin Project CSS Landing Page. HTML and CSS will be made from scratch to emulate a layout from a picture.

Just finished the project. I think some of the things I learned that were the hardest for me was more div containers! Flexbox relies on those containers. This is actually my second time doing the project because the first time I did not have enough divs and it was not working at all, so I needed to scrap and start over.
